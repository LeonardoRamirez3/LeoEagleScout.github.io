							<h2>Origins</h2>
							<p>I began my journey in 2015 at my local Troop, after moving to Troop 553 in Santa Fe Springs, I felt very included and encouraged to participate in outings. Although it was difficult in the beginning, as time went on, I began feeling like part of them and it felt like family. </p>

							<h2>Outings</h2>
							<p>Over the course of several years, the Boy Scouts of America Association requires us to participate in several activities like summer camp. We have gone from fishing to camping to hiking in almost any of the local spots. My favorite outing was the first time we visited French Camp in Inyo National Forest. I believe all of these outings had an emotional impact on me. Each night, when we all gathered around the campfire eating, talking, messing around, doing pranks, it felt like my safe space. It was so therapeutic that all my concerns and fears went away, it felt amazing being surrounded by these awesome people.</p>

							<h2>Eagle Project</h2>
							<p>One of the last requirements to become an Ragle Scout is to plan and execute a community service project. There are various rules to this like not being able to fund my own project with my own money, and not being able to do anything physical during the project. All of this is done to challenge the Eagle applicant into demonstrating all the leadership lessons learned throughout their time as a Boy Scout.</p>
							<p>My porject originated from the anxiety and stress I experienced when I first moved to Los Angeles in 2015. I realized that plants and nature as a whole made me happier and lowered my stress levels significantly. Therefore, in order to combat the very same stress and anxiety not only students experienced, but also teachers and community members, I decided to creat a mental health garden in my Elementary School. This whole project took a total of 6 months to plan and complete with all the permissions that I needed to get signed and confirmed as well as the donations I had to ask for. It was a great test of my leadership and I believe that it was an important part of my journey towards achieving the Eagle Rank.</p>

							<h2>Lessons</h2>
							<p>A Boy Scout is Trustworthy, Loyal, Helpful, Friendly, Courteous, Kind, Obedient, Cheerful, Thrifty, Brave, Clean, and Reverent.</p>
							<p>On my honor, I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law, to help other people at all times, to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally, straight.</p>
							<p>These are the Scout Oath and Law, and they are what every good Scout should strive to live by. These are the points that I learned to live by, and although I may fail sometimes, I always remember and do my best to be better. Being and Eagle Scout doesn't mean that it is a one time achievement, rather, it is a reminder of all the lessons learned, and a reminder to always be an example to others and to lead others. After all, Once an Eagle, Always an Eagle .</p>
